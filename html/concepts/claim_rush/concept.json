  "core_loop": "You continuously move, dragging a colored trail behind you. Venture out from your safe claimed territory into neutral or enemy ground, then loop back to your own color to fill everything you enclosed. The longer you stay outside your territory the more you can claim \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but your exposed trail is vulnerable. If any rival crosses your trail before you close the loop, you lose your life and unclaimed path. Rivals get faster and more aggressive each round. Survive and claim 80%+ of the arena to win each level.",
