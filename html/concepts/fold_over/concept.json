  "perspective": "top-down",
  "core_loop": "You see a flat square 'paper' divided into colored cells and a small target pattern. Drag a fold line across the paper to fold one half onto the other, layering colors. The top-visible color after each fold changes the pattern. Keep folding until your visible surface matches the target. Fewer folds = more stars. Misfolding covers wrong colors, forcing creative recovery folds or a quick undo.",
