  "core_loop": "Your car constantly accelerates forward on an endless highway. Hold left side of screen to drift left, hold right to drift right, release to glide straight. Weave between oncoming vehicles \u00e2\u20ac\u201d each near-miss adds to a combo multiplier that multiplies your score but also nudges your speed higher. Clip a vehicle and you spin out, losing your combo and slowing down. Three crashes and you're done. Coins appear in dangerous gaps between cars for bonus points. Every 30 seconds traffic density and patterns shift \u00e2\u20ac\u201d convoys, staggered waves, speed demons that swerve.",
