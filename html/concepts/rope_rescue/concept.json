  "core_loop": "Survivors fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds and angles. You drag between two anchor points on walls, ledges, and platforms to stretch a rope line. Survivors bounce off your ropes and you must chain multiple rope lines to guide them into a rescue zone at the bottom. Ropes have limited elasticity \u00e2\u20ac\u201d after 3 bounces a rope snaps and disappears, so you're constantly laying new lines while managing which ropes are about to break. Mistime a rope and survivors splat. Each level sends faster, heavier, and more simultaneous survivors while giving you trickier anchor point layouts.",
