  "core_loop": "Objects of various sizes scroll toward you from the right. Tap/click on them to zap with your shrink ray \u00e2\u20ac\u201d they shrink to tiny size but ricochet off walls and floor at high speed. You dodge vertically (drag/swipe up-down or arrow keys) to avoid both the incoming large objects AND the tiny bouncing ones you created. Shrinking objects scores points and clears space, but every zap adds a new fast-moving hazard to the arena. The screen gradually fills with your own ricochets, creating escalating self-inflicted chaos. Combo multipliers for rapid-fire shrinking, and periodic 'reverse ray' pickups let you RE-GROW a tiny bouncer into a slow, harmless big object to clear breathing room.",
