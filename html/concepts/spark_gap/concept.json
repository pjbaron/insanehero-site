  "perspective": "top-down",
  "core_loop": "A charge builds at a glowing terminal \u00e2\u20ac\u201d drag to draw a wire path through the board to reach the target terminal before the energy bar depletes. Obstacles like capacitors, resistors, and live wires block your route; crossing another wire causes a short that blows one of your three fuses. Each completed connection powers up a section of the board, revealing new terminal pairs at faster drain rates. Longer paths score more but risk running out of charge. Every few connections trigger a 'surge round' where multiple pairs must be linked simultaneously under a shared timer.",

    "Board progressively lights up as you complete connections \u00e2\u20ac\u201d satisfying visual payoff of powering a whole circuit",

  "controls": "Touch/mouse drag to draw wire paths from source terminal to target terminal. Tap a drawn wire to erase it and reroute. That's it \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one finger, one action.",
