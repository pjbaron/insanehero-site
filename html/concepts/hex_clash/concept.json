  "perspective": "top-down",
  "core_loop": "You and an AI take rapid alternating turns placing hex tiles on a honeycomb grid. Placing a tile next to enemy tiles that are fully surrounded flips them to your color. Each turn you pick from 2-3 offered tiles with different shapes (single, double, L-shaped clusters) and tap where to place them. Rounds last 60 seconds with a shrinking playable border that forces confrontation. Score = tiles you control when time runs out or the board fills.",
