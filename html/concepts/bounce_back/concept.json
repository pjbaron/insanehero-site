  "perspective": "front-facing orthographic",
  "core_loop": "Player drags to aim an arc from the top of the screen, releases to drop a ball. The ball bounces off pegs (which light up and vanish), pinball bumpers, and spinning obstacles on its way down. Landing zones at the bottom award score multipliers (1x to 10x). Cleared pegs refill after each round with new randomized layouts and added hazards. Every few rounds a bonus ball or power-up peg appears (explosive peg clears neighbors, magnet peg curves the ball). You start with 5 balls; hitting enough pegs per shot earns extra balls. Game ends when balls run out.",
