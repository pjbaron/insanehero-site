The XML format text localisations were converted to JSON using this online tool:
https://www.browserling.com/tools/xml-to-json

Please note that many similar tools exist which may not respect the UTF-8 encoding correctly e.g. http://codebeautify.org/xmltojson

To convert new files, copy the xml file content (select all, copy to clipboard).
Paste it into the conversion window, and press the 'convert!' button.
Copy the new window contents (JSON data) and paste them into a "strings.json" in
the appropriate country folder.
NOTE: make sure you *replace* any data which is already in the file, don't append to the end of it!

The HTML5 game will only load the JSON files, so it is ok to leave the original XML files there for reference.
