# WordPix
Fit a word cloud to match an image layout, words are horizontal and scaled.

TODO:
- read colours from image and create separate profiles for how each colour will be processed
- experiment with movement and GIF output, move large words faster for depth illusion
- optional colour settings based on size of font
- proximity detection to discourage multiple instances of a word in one region
- enhance prox detection to especially avoid similar sized same words being close together
- expose all parameters through a webpage with drop zones for image and word files and a colour picker
