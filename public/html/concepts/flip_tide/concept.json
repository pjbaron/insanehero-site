  "core_loop": "Your surfer auto-scrolls right. Tap/click to flip between riding the top of the water and clinging to the cave ceiling below. Obstacles alternate \u00e2\u20ac\u201d jagged coral hangs from the ceiling, crashing waves roll along the surface. You must constantly flip between the two lanes, timing each switch to thread through safe gaps. Collectible shells appear in risky positions. Speed gradually increases and the gap between surface and ceiling narrows, compressing your reaction window. Bonus 'riptide' zones temporarily reverse your scroll direction, forcing you to dodge obstacles you already passed from a new angle.",
