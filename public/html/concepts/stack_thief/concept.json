  "core_loop": "Towers of varied blocks sway with physics on screen. Tap/swipe a block from any rival tower to yank it out \u00e2\u20ac\u201d it flies to the top of your tower. Your tower sways more with each addition. Time your steals carefully: pulling a load-bearing block collapses the rival tower (bonus points), but stacking too fast makes YOUR tower wobble and fall (round over). Each round lasts 30-60 seconds with a rising 'earthquake' rumble that intensifies wobble, forcing risky plays.",
