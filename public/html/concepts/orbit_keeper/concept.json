  "core_loop": "Planets drift onto screen one at a time. You tap/click to launch a moon toward a planet \u00e2\u20ac\u201d if it lands in the gravitational sweet spot, it locks into orbit and scores points. Each planet can hold multiple moons at different orbital rings. As your solar system grows, orbiting moons create an increasingly dense web of spinning paths. You must time new launches to thread through gaps between existing orbits. Moons that collide with each other shatter, triggering a chain reaction that can destroy nearby moons. Survive as long as possible while maximizing your constellation of orbiting moons.",
