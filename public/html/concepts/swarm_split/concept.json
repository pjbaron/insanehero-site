  "perspective": "top-down",
  "core_loop": "Your swarm follows your finger as a blob. Swipe through the swarm to cleave it into two groups \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one follows you, the other charges toward the nearest enemy base. Critters auto-fight when they reach a base, and you need numeric superiority to capture it. Captured bases spawn reinforcements. Each 60-second round you must capture all bases on the map. The tension is deciding when to split (send an attack) versus when to keep your numbers together for a tougher base. Swarm pieces left idle slowly wander and can be recollected by dragging through them.",
